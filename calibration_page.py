st.markdown("<h4>Calibration Setup</h4> The PillCam introduces significant distortions. \
            This is mainly geometric distortion from the wide-angle lens as well as \
            compression artifacts and distortion in color reproduction. Further, technical specification like \
            intrinsic parameters as well as details on the image processing chain, \
            is not provided by the manufacturer. For many applications, it is therefore \
            essential to conduct both geometric- and radiometric calibration.", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("In our dataset, there are captures of a ColorChecker and a checkerboard.\
            <ul><li> The ColorChecker provides a reference for color correction, aiding in better \
            color reproduction in GI images. </li> </ul> <ul><li> The checkerboard can aid in geometric calibration, reducing geometric distortion in images and thereby ensuring \
                accurate spatial relationships, and help estimate the cameras intrinsic parameters </li> </ul>",unsafe_allow_html=True)
